We use python and youtube api to get the data that we need in this case it the title, likes,views commnets
of all videos in a playlist
we store this into a kafka table,
we use Stream to subscribe to table changes, in this case youtube_changes_stream subscribes to kafka topic of table 'youtube_changes'

So the youtube_changes table has the changes, the youtube_changes_stream is sub to kafka topic of youtube_changs table
then we create a stream to output to telegram, then to bridge between youtube_changes_stream and telegram_outbox_stream we use insert into

then we set up a http sink connector for telegram outbox stream , this will send event in telegram_outbox stream to telegram api using our token for our bot
we harcode the chatId that  telegram needs in the telegram_outbox stream
telegram recieves json object with chatId and text fields

#TO get chat id, paste your token after /bot
